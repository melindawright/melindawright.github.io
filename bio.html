			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Born May 2, 1992 in Spokane, Wa. I am a server at a local restaurant and a full time student at Eastern Washington University. </p>
			<h2>Professional Objectives</h2>
			<p>I am currently a senior working towards my bachelor&#39;s degree in Visual Communication Designs. I have a minor in psychology which will help me gain an understanding of my clients to better fit their ideas that they are wanting. I am hoping to learn so much from this graphic design industry and to become an amazing established designer.</p>
			<p>In Fall 2014 I will be going to school, interning for graphic designing and photography and then graduating at the University of Richmond in Rome, Italy. From that program I am hoping to flourish my skills and become an advid and very marketable graphic designer and photographer.</p>
